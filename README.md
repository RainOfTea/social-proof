## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup & CSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

You can't always trust browser devtools. I spent hours trying to figure out why Brave couldn't show a simple layout when Firefox did it perfectly, and then it somehow just started working.

Also, less is more when it comes to layouts - no need to overcomplicate things, as it can lead to several CSS conflicts.
